# AddressIQ

**addressIQ** is an open‑source Python toolkit for fast, accurate address intelligence. Whether you need geocoding, reverse geocoding, Placekey lookups, or synthetic address generation from Overture Maps data, AddressIQ makes it easy to prototype, test, and scale.

## 🚀Proposed Key Value

* **Synthetic Address Generation**: Leverage real-world address records from Overture Maps to create large-scale test datasets, powered by GeoPandas and PyArrow.
* **High-Performance Geocoding**: Forward and reverse geocoding endpoints optimized for batch workloads and low latency.
* **Placekey Integration**: Instantly resolve or assign Placekeys to addresses, simplifying interoperability across location platforms.
* **Extensible AI/NER Parsing**: Plug in custom named‑entity recognition (NER) or contextual address parsers for advanced address normalization and security use‑cases.
* **Graph & Network Ready**: Export data for network analysis or integrate with graph databases to model relationships between AddressIQ outputs and incident data.

## 🔭 Roadmap & Extensions

* **Address Security**: NER‑driven PII detection and anonymization.
* **Graph Analysis**: Export to Neo4j or NetworkX for crime‑incident linking.
* **Contextual Parsing**: Integrate transformer‑based models to handle global address formats.
